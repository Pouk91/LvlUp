Application:

The purpose of the application is to keep track of a users workouts. They can sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and change passwords. Once a user is signed in they are provided form fields that are able to enter, update, and delete workouts. Users are also able to get their list of workouts by clicking on the button.

Approach:

My approach in building the application was creating my backend one to many relationships. After that was completed I created the basic HTML and CSS framework. My main focus was ensuring the front-end and back-end were connecting correctly. Also that my API methods were behaving as expected.

Unsolved Problems:

Haven't quite figured out handlebars at the moment to delete or update items. Need to research to have buttons work correctly.

User Stores:
